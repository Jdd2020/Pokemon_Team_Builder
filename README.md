# Pokemon_Team_Builder
### Web-application that aids the user in building a Pokemon team for the popular video-game franchise, Pokemon.

---

I'm a longtime fan of the franchise and wanted to work on a project while I complete a job search, hopefully this will be able to be used by other fans as a fun aid that can be used during playthroughs or for compettitve team selections. Right now though, focused on getting the base functionalites working listed below.

Features being worked on include the following:
- Add a member
- Delete a member
- Recommend a new meber
- View Stats
- Suggest attributes

Recommendations will first be based on typing and base stats, but further complexities will be added with the EV's.

Further along in the process, program will be turned into a RESTful API and be accompanied by a web-app.
